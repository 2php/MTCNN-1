# MTCNN

Repository for "[Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878)", implemented with Caffe, C++ interface. Compared with Cascade CNN, MTCNN integrates the detection net and calibration net into one net. Moreover, face alignment is also applied in the same net.

## Result

### Face Detection
